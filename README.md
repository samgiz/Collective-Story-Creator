The idea of this application is to have an intuitive story-based game editor and viewer that would allow people to create stories without any programming knowledge. I hope that it inspires people to create some great stories and maybe even collaborate through github to make some massive stories.

Currently I have only made a super basic viewer of such games that can be made using a simplistic folder structure. Even the story representation is flawed, since the paths cannot exceed 5000 characters in Linux (and even less in windows). The representation will be the first thing to change, I just wanted to save the initial "working" project. :)

Since there is no editor currently, the only way one can write stories is by hand, following the pattern in the ExampleStory.

Once there's a working story viewer, I will start working on an editor and will try to add more functionalities.
