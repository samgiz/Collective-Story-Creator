# Project overview

The idea of this project is to have an intuitive and highly customizable way to create Choose Your Own Adventure games collectively. It will consist of 2 parts: the game viewer and the editor.

## Viewer
The viewer part of the project is currently fully functional, although not very pretty, but I'm mostly interested in the functionality, not aesthetics. It also includes the most boring example story you could ever imagine just to illustrate how it works. I would be glad if someone artistic could improve either of them. :)

## Editor

The editor part has not been started yet but that's what I'll be working on next. I would like to preferably have a way to share the created stories through github or some similar platform, so as to make collaborative story creation possible.
