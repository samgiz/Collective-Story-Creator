The idea of this application is to have an intuitive story-based game editor and viewer that would allow people to create stories without any programming knowledge. I hope that it inspires people to create some great stories and maybe even collaborate through github to make some massive stories, with extremely different plots.

Currently I have only made a super basic viewer of games with a rather simplistic file structure. Since there currently is no editor, the only way one can write stories is by hand, following the pattern in the ExampleStory.

Once the story viewer is reasonably finished, I will start developing the editor.
